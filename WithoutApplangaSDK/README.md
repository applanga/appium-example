# Appium plus App integrated via Applanga CLI Example

In this example, the Appium framework is used to run a test script that navigates through an app integrated with the Applanga Command Line Interface (CLI). Besides the navigational aspect, the Appium test scripts are extended to take a screenshot of every view and upload that screenshot to Applanga.  

There are 2 different integration examples, one for an `Android` application and one `iOS` version.
